        <h2>A bit about myself...</h2><br>
          <p>My name is Max!  I am a practicing <span class="life">glass</span> artist and educator born in <span class="wa">Tacoma, WA</span> and currently residing in the <span class="wa">San Juan islands</span>.  My primary focus is traditional Venitian style <span class="life">glassblowing</span>, and for the last 8 years, I have dedicated most of my time to gaining as much working experience with the material as possbile.  When I'm not in the studio, <span class="zzz">(or sleeping)</span>, I prefer to spend my time outside.  I was born in Washington and grew up hiking, swimming, skiing and climbing and it still never ceases to amaze me that we have world-class access to so many activites within an hour or two here in WA.  If I had to really narrow it down I would say my favorite things are:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Reading!</li>
              <li>Anything glass-related!</li>
              <li>Some well-timed music</li>
              <li>FRESH AIR</li>
              <li>A hilarious joke!</li>

        <h2>A little bit about how I got here...</h2><br>
          <p>I have been interested in learning more about coding for several years, but was usnure of exactly how to go about it.  I see this class, and web development in general, as an oppurtunity to ensure that I am always engaged with something that will challenge me to continuously adapt and learn new things.  A big part of my attraction to glass is that I am constantly challenged to learn and apply new things, and improve upon what I already know. It is an incredibly demanding material; you can spend your whole life in pursuit of mastery and there will always be something new to discover, some new way to burn yourself, or some technique to refine and improve upon which is immensely satisfying.  I see much similair potential with development and coding, and in many ways it is equally as exciting to me.  My goal is to provide myself with a greater degree of long-term flexibility in my life, and to do so in a way that will remain dynamic and engaging for years to come.  Much like with glass, as I gain knowledge and practice I grow more and more excited to think of new ideas and attempt to execute them in an elegant way.
