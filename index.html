        <h2>A bit about myself...</h2><br>
          <p>My name is Max!  I am a practicing <span class="life">glass</span> artist and educator born in <span class="wa">Tacoma, WA</span> and currently residing in the <span class="wa">San Juan islands</span>.  My primary focus is traditional Venitian style <span class="life">glassblowing</span>, and for the last 8 years, I have dedicated most of my time to gaining as much working experience with the material as possbile.  When I'm not in the studio, <span class="zzz">(or sleeping)</span>, I prefer to spend my time outside.  I was born in Washington and grew up hiking, swimming, skiing and climbing and it still never ceases to amaze me that we have world-class access to so many activites within an hour or two here in WA.  If I had to really narrow it down I would say my favorite things are:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Reading!</li>
              <li>Anything glass-related!</li>
              <li>Some well-timed music</li>
              <li>FRESH AIR</li>
              <li>A hilarious joke!</li>
            </ol>
